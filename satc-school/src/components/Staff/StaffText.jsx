            At SATC-CCA, our team is made up of passionate educators, teacher
            aides, therapists, and directors dedicated to supporting children.
            We are committed to creating a safe, secure, inclusive, and
            nurturing environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our lead teachers are certified speech-language pathologists (SLPs),
            bringing a unique blend of educational and therapeutic expertise to
            our classrooms. This dual qualification allows them to seamlessly
            integrate speech and language development strategies into daily
            instruction, enhancing communication skills alongside academic
            learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that every child deserves a space where they feel safe,
            supported, and celebrated. Thatâ€™s why we are committed to
            maintaining an all-inclusive, loving, respectful, kind, caring, and
            bully-free zone.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              We do not discriminate, and we do not tolerate exclusion,
              bullying, or anything that threatens the emotional or physical
              well-being of our students.
