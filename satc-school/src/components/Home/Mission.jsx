            Communication Cultivation Academy (SATC-CCA), we are dedicated to
            creating a nurturing and inclusive therapeutic learning environment
            for nonverbal and minimally verbal children with autism and other
            developmental delays.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our approach combines evidence-based educational strategies, a
            well-rounded curriculum, and integrated speech and occupational
            therapy. Our therapists create individualized learning experiences
            tailored to each child's unique strengths and needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            We believe that all forms of communication count! Communication is
            the foundation of social connection, community, and independence.
            Through structured learning, sensory-friendly classrooms, and
            supportive interventions, we empower our students to thrive
            academically, socially, and emotionally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Positive Behavioral Support (PBS) </strong> is the system we
            use at SATC-CCA. PBS is a research-based approach that uses
            environmental systems to prevent or intervene in problem behaviors
            before they occur.
          </p>

          <p>
            At SATC-CCA, we stand firm in our belief that every child deserves
            respect, kindness, support, and the opportunity to thrive in a safe,
            welcoming community.

                <li>
                  Focuses on instructional strategies rather than negative
                  consequences (unlike ABA).
                </li>
                <li>Supports observable and measurable behavior.</li>
                <li>
                  Ensures interventions are respectful of the individualâ€™s life
                  and circumstances.

          At SATC-CCA, we go beyond traditional education by providing a
          therapy-integrated approach that meets each child where they are.
          Here's what sets us apart:
